# 626. Exchange Seats

**Table:** ```Seat```

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
```

# **Task:**

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

# **Example:**

**Input:**

```
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
```

**Output:**

```
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
```

**Explanation:**

Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

# **Solution 1:**

``` SQL
SELECT id,
       (CASE
            WHEN id%2 = 1
                 AND lead(student) OVER(ORDER BY id) IS NULL THEN student
            WHEN id%2 = 0 THEN lag(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)
            WHEN id%2 = 1 THEN lead(student) OVER(ORDER BY id)
        END) AS student
FROM seat;
```

# **Solution 2:**

``` SQL
SELECT CASE
           WHEN s1.id%2=1
                AND s1.id<
                  (SELECT COUNT(*)
                   FROM seat) THEN s1.id+1
           WHEN s1.id%2=0 THEN s1.id-1
           ELSE s1.id
       END AS id,
       s1.student
FROM seat s1
ORDER BY id
```

# **Solution 3:**

``` SQL
SELECT id, (
    CASE
        WHEN id%2=0 THEN LAG(student, 1) OVER(ORDER BY id)
        ELSE LEAD(student, 1, student) OVER (ORDER BY id)
    END
) AS student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
```
