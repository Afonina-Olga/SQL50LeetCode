# 180. Consecutive Numbers

**Table:** ```Logs```

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
```

# **Task:**

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

# **Example:**

**Input:**

```
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
```

**Output:**

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

**Explanation:**

1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

# **Solution:**
``` SQL
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT 
        num,
        LEAD(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next1,
        LEAD(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next2
    FROM Logs
) t
WHERE num = next1 AND num = next2;
```
